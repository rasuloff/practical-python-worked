# Exercise 1.7: Dave’s mortgage
# Dave has decided to take out a 30-year fixed rate mortgage of $500,000 with Guido’s Mortgage, Stock Investment, and Bitcoin trading corporation. The interest rate is 5% and the monthly payment is $2684.11.

# Here is a program that calculates the total amount that Dave will have to pay over the life of the mortgage:

# mortgage.py

# principal = 500000.0
# rate = 0.05
# payment = 2684.11
# total_paid = 0.0

# while principal > 0:
#     principal = principal * (1+rate/12) - payment
#     total_paid = total_paid + payment

# print('Total paid', total_paid)

# Enter this program and run it. You should get an answer of 966,279.6.

# Worked 1.7

principal = 500000.0
rate = 0.05
payment = 2684.11
total_paid = 0.0

while principal > 0:
    principal = principal * (1 + rate/12) - payment
    total_paid = total_paid + payment

print('Total paid', total_paid)
