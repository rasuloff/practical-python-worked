# Exercise 1.10: Making a table
# Modify the program to print out a table showing the month, total paid so far, and the remaining principal. The output should look something like this:

# 1 2684.11 499399.22
# 2 5368.22 498795.94
# 3 8052.33 498190.15
# 4 10736.44 497581.83
# 5 13420.55 496970.98
# ...
# 308 874705.88 3478.83
# 309 877389.99 809.21
# 310 880074.1 -1871.53
# Total paid 880074.1
# Months 310
